Competition stories, world records, national events, and any story related to air sports on a USA national level is welcome. Please see keywords for particular air sports.

I will always accept stories about competitions and world records. Keep in mind these stories should be after the competition or record is complete.

FYI, so I don't waste your time, I do reject stories for being in one of the 'Quick and Dirty Rejects' below.

The Quick and Dirty Rejects:
1) No local flying club articles. Subject matter should be pointed to national level or international level. 

2) No grandma goes hang gliding, skydiving, etc. 

3) No articles where pilot dies or injured.

4) No articles where local reporter goes hang gliding, skydiving, etc.

5) No articles about 'what is hang gliding?', 'what is paramotoring?', etc. 

6) Due to my limited number of articles purchased, I can only accept competition write-ups after the competition is complete. No preview stories of upcoming competitions please. 

7) No biographicals unless included as part of a story about one of the pilots in a competition. There should be more emphasis on the competition than the pilots bio. 

8) No combined competition articles. If there are 3 competition active, I prefer an article for each competition rather one article for all three.

NOW A NATONAL FORMAT

We publish a monthly newsletter for real estate agents to send to their clients. Almost all of our readers are homeowners. Our general content is seasonal so it is always changing. We prefer the content to be a quick read, conversational, light and friendly in tone and interesting. Clever and fun is good.

The newsletter publisher believes that his readers will only spend  a maximum of 2 minutes on the inside spread. This means the articles need to be skimmable with interesting headlines, subheads to break up the copy, bullets and very short chunks of copy.

This is a printed newsletter. Please do not rely on links unless asked to do so. All articles should stand on their own with NO REFERENCE to the real estate agents. 

Page size is 8.5 x 11 so please write copy length accordingly. 
Full page = 400 words

Write with subheads and possibly bullets to make the articles skimable. 

ALL ARTICLES MUST INCLUDE A SUMMARY SENTENCE FOR THE TABLE OF CONTENTS. This sentence in addition to the word count.

The goal of the articles is to provide as much factual information as possible to the reader about the topic. If the article is about a DIY project, include where the pieces and parts can be purchased. If the article is about party planning, we need to say specifically where to get the items mentioned. As in all journalism, please keep in mind WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN and HOW.

This is a national publication so don't be specific to any city state or region.

PLEASE DO NOT LINK BACK TO OUR WEBSITE. Our readers cannot link from a printed newsletter and it is annoying to deal with in layout.

Here is a link to nine past issues so you can see the type of copy we prefer:

Key differences to traditional nursing homes.
See http://www.glenvalevillas.com.au/no-to-nursing-homes
 for more info:

The care of an aged care facility, with the independence of a retirement village.
Residents buy in and own their own home. Traditional nursing home system in Australia uses a bond system - you never own your home. 
Homes are fully self contained with kitchen, lounge, bedroom, laundry and balcony. Traditional nursing homes give you one room with a bed and bathroom.
Homes are 3 times the size of nursing home rooms.
Residents have full independence to come and go as they like.
Residents have a network of 24/7 nursing care around them, which we call a Continuous Care system
Continuous Care is available from low care right up to high care general nursing, providing true ageing-in-place. When residents' care needs increase they do not need to move out.
Continuous Care can increase to your needs and reduce when you don’t need as much care.
Continuous Care is individualised, so couples with different care needs can stay together. The traditional nursing home system will split them apart.
Residents also have a support network (domestic) that will help with everything from doing the laundry to supplying meals.
Residents can choose to make their own meals in their own homes, eat in the community restaurant, or have meals from the restaurant delivered to their door.
Residents only pay for what they use. Fees increase if care or support increases, but fees also reduce when care and support reduces. 
A Director of Care monitors all residents regularly to provide preventative care.
A Registered Nurse is on staff. 
Residents can alter and decorate their homes as they wish.
Residents can sell their home when they move out.

Main focus of blog:
Fresh content weekly.
Aged care has a negative perception of old style nursing homes, which still exist. Attempting to educate market that we are different. 
Most website visitors are the adult children (50-60 years old) of those needing aged care. They have strong emotions about their parents welfare, and usually stubborn parents.
A visit to the community normally changes people’s perceptions completely, but getting them to visit is difficult.
People are hesitant to move to aged care because they feel their life will be over. Attempting to educate that they still have full independence and their own home.
Crisis is usually the main decision maker, which is often too late. Attempting to educate market to be ‘forward thinkers’

Terms to use:
Community - never use ‘facility’
Older - never use ‘elderly’
Residents - never use ‘patients'
Aged care - never use ‘retirement'
Never use ‘nursing home’ unless referring to the traditional system.",300,Basic - 300 words,,6,118,0,active,2017-11-15T00:00:00.000-07:00,,233

Genetoo is the result of a Startup Competition that its team won.

Startup NASA helps address two of the biggest challenges faced by start-up companies: raising capital and securing intellectual property rights. By eliminating up-front licensing fees, NASA is letting new companies hold onto their cash while securing the intellectual property rights needed to secure their competitive market space. This benefit is available to companies formed to commercialize NASA technology.  In addition, to foster the creation of new start-up companies and encourage adoption of NASA technologies, NASA will work with the CAI to run a multi-phase business plan competition in 2016. CAI will review NASA’s portfolio of technologies and identify those that have near-term commercialization potential.  CAI will conduct outreach teams to explore the market potential of the technologies and write business plans.

John Magruder and his wife Tyan run the company; they have been our clients for some years now.  To their clients, they wish to project an image of quality, trust, value for $, reliability, expertise, and and also that they (Magruder Homes) are active members of the B/CS community.  

They focus on designing and building brand new custom homes, as well as remodeling existing homes.

Please see the following pages:
http://magruderhomes.com/about/
http://magruderhomes.com/services/
http://magruderhomes.com/gallery/

A few points about the client:
-The target for these blogs is primarily the wife of an upper-middle class household, as she is typically the decision maker who ends up picking one custom home builder over another.  Posts do not necessarily need to be feminine, but please keep in mind that she is often the end buyer.

-Magruder's target market is highly regional, within say a 50-100 mile stretch of Bryan/College Station.  The greater area which MH serves is also known as ""The Brazos Valley.""  

-John is a stickler for grammar, spelling, etc.  Please be extra-cautious in your spell check/grammar check, etc.

For all Magruder blogs, the best way to find inspiration is to look at what they are currently building/doing on their Facebook and Instagram. Look specifically at the homes they are showcasing in the photos of their social media and features you see in them.

These products were developed on the principle that stored items can be brought to the person, rather than the person having to find the items in storage.

Our units provide:
1. Increased floor space - Vertical storage frees existing floor space that can be used to store more inventory or add additional services and production capacity, without the high cost of new construction.  Customers can often reclaim up to 80% of their floor space.
2. Increased inventory accuracy - Hänel's inventory management options can improve inventory accuracy to over 99%, reducing the likelihood of overstocking, parts shortages, expired items and the time spent on correcting errors.
3. Increased productivity - A customer's staff can pick and place more parts in less time, with fewer people, for significant time savings and a boost to their overall productivity.
4. Increased inventory security - All valuable inventory is stored within an enclosed unit, under lock and key for enhanced security.  Further protection by password access, keycard swipe or RFID reader provides further security.
5. Improved ergonomics - Stored items are brought directly to the operator, so our customer's staff no longer has to walk along rows of shelving, climbing or stooping to find items, or carry heavy or bulky items up and down ladders.

Our units store everything from paper records to small parts to large items...Items ranging from nuts and bolts to entire engine blocks.

The name ""Hänel"" has stood for innovative solutions and quality since the 1950s.  Our storage solutions are custom-manufactured for every customer, so they are sure to meet the needs of the application.  We have provided storage solutions for manufacturing, tooling, automotive, healthcare, pharmacy, government, warehousing & distribution, aviation & aerospace, construction, engineering, electronics, pharmaceuticals, toys and many other industries.

The blog is meant to provide value for individuals in the software developer community that are looking for ways to jump start their career in software development. The tone should be a very friendly narrative, as if I am talking to my friend that has been a professional software developer for awhile now, and can explain some of the complex topics engineers face on a daily basis in relatively simple words. An excellent example of the type of articles that I am trying to produce can be found here -> https://simpleprogrammer.com/. My audience, tone, and article topics will almost mirror this site. Another article that you can use for reference is from my own site (which is where I will be posting the content that you provide) and can be found here -> https://jasonroell.com/2017/02/16/the-perfect-storm-that-has-enabled-the-explosion-of-artificial-intelligence/ .
Again, keep in mind that I should come across as the authority on the subjects but the articles should be geared towards someone that is not yet an expert in that domain. The end goal should be to develop a dedicated audience that trusts the content that I am producing and would be interested in paying for my developer training classes that I provide. However, I want to STAY CLEAR of any type of promotional tone because the main purpose is to build trust with an audience that sees me as a friend explaining complex topics in a simple, relaxed, and fun manner.

We also offer doula support for birth and postpartum. We work with women at hospitals, at home or birth centers providing support during labor.

Our ideal client is a pregnant woman, or couple planning to start their families. Income level of $100,000 or greater.

All information that I share needs to be evidence based. When referring to websites please use websites that are geared to natural childbirth, alternative medicine, health & fitness. Try  to stay away from sites like WebMd, mayo clinic, and medical universities. 

At the end of each blog, there needs to be a call to action of some sort. Refer back to my child birth education classes, our doula services, post partum support groups, etc. 

My goal is to teach, encourage, and support women and young families during an often confusing time in their lives - pregnancy, birth and beyond!  I want my posts to be personal, warm and friendly and less academic.  While they need to be factual and accurate - they need to be geared more to a hormonal pregnant woman who needs me.

White Space Marketing Group has written 300+ blogs at a velocity of 2/week since 2015. The business is booming with more content marketing and new products.
As DMD moves away from plain vanilla pharma and hospital email marketing to data intelligence garnered from their authenticated database, their penetration of the email marketing prospect base continues to grow. And their pharma customers and prospects are onboarding their new product DMDs Audience Identity Manager as a way for pharma clients to know the identity of the HCPs visiting their websites (as opposed to patients or consumers) and what they're interested in when they get there.
The company blog is huge: go to 'all posts' at the bottom of the blog digest page and you'll see lists of different blogs to different audiences (pharma, hospitals, continuing medical education, physician recruiters, publishers) around different products (email, AIM).
The DMD tone is meant to be delivered in a legit, professional voice with a small smile and little attitude of making fun of pharma and hospital marketers who don't realize how they can up their game with data.
Their ads are snarky, their blogs throw down the gauntlet, all with an affectionate feel of ""we can help you!""
--> Blog content, though not selling our 'stuff' we do want the solutions to refer to benefits inherent in DMD's products and services

This way I can provide some interesting historical information and at the same time let people know that businesses have been failing for centuries and what we must do is learn from these failures. The lessons learnt from historical failures are relevant today. 

Stories such as why Western Union said no to Bell or why the AOL merger with Time warner was such a disater. There would be plenty more. What really happened at Enron.

It provides both  parties equally powerful application with full-blown capabilities, making the process efficient and agile. Also core to CENTRL’s platform are the collaboration features.Intra-company & inter-company collaboration is available at the most granular levels within the application.This eliminates the need to go out-of-band and the context is never lost emails.

There are 2 modules in CENTRL that can be packaged into 3 different products. The modules are:
1) Documents: Allows companies to request or publish documents to/from partners. This includes documents like metrics, financial reports, policy documents, security and compliance documents etc.
2) Questionnaires: Allows companies to conduct variety of assessments, conduct due diligence and gather relevant information from partners or third parties.. This includes information security assessments, financial due diligence, onsite audits, vendor risk assessments etc.

Our design is light, airy, clean, and we'd love content that reflects that tone and style. We are in a very visual industry so when we include inspiration photos you are encouraged to write about them directly- we will add them to the posts before publishing.

1) People - Content about individual contributors, including building a team, team structure, making a team better, hiring the right skillset for Data and Analytics teams
2) Process - Content about how to do things better, like project management, documentation, user adoption practices, technical code
3) Technology - Content about something that would be purchased outright, like a cloud server, Google Adwords, ERPs, CRMs, Qlik, Sisense, Microsoft, products, etc.

Our Vision and Content Strategy

The purpose of our blog is to generate brand awareness and sales leads.  To do this, we try to make our blog:
•	Informative
•	Interesting
•	Relevant to our products and services

Sample topics may include industry trends, explanations of technical concepts, application of technologies to real life use cases, etc.

Our target audience: 
Enterprises (or rather, the people that work at the companies) that want to expand digitally into other regions of the world, for example:
•	Video streaming service in the U.S. that wants to improve its user experience (decrease latency, improve video quality) in Brazil
•	Mobile gaming company in Russia that wants to make sure its Indonesian users do not experience lag when playing its games

Our differentiation:
•	Global coverage: six continents, 25+ countries (including countries that are traditionally difficult to get into, such as China, India, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, etc.), 70+ data centers
•	On-demand SD-WAN: dedicated (private) networks that allow enterprises to bypass congestion on the public Internet that can be provisioned on-demand with a pay-as-you-go payment model
•	Service: rapid deployment (multiple sites at the same time), quick responses (support response time < 30 minutes), 24/7 English and Chinese technical support

 
Tone/Style details for our blog:
•	Conversational tone
•	Post must help readers accomplish something, and/or learn from examples.
•	Detailed explanations of our industry
•	Short, concise paragraphs that are easy to read
•	Fully formatted sections to make posts easy to skim through",900,Content - 900+ words,IT & Data Security,1,5,0,expired,2017-07-23T00:00:00.000-06:00,2017-09-14T00:00:00.000-06:00,62

We also like to share things about our doggie ice cream and dog tea.  We specialize in items that are hard to find and you won't be able to find most of our products just anywhere.  We also now offer Subscription of dog treats.  For example, if you buy a subscription of doggie chicken chips, its 15% off your first bag and 10% off any remaining orders.  The customer gets to decide how often they want the bags shipped to them.  We also have  a loyatly program.  

For the blog portion feel free to create content that doesn't have to do with our products but are highly searched topics by dog owners.  I am looking to gather more traffic of the general nature from dog owners as a whole.  We have an app on our online store that shows other people buying things while they are reading, I am hoping that too will help encourage them to go shopping after they  are finished reading their blog articles.  

If this goes well, I may also have you all make more blogs for my dog training website ReallyGoodPets.com  

I created the business in 2013 as an In-Home Dog training company in Oklahoma.  Now we still have the dog training and it is booming but we expanded to offer the online store as well.  Tre Ponti and Doggie Chicken Chips and DogSheetz are the products that put us on the e-commerce map.

They have a history of clients that say, “ I read this on the internet”…. Therefore, we are not looking for “Fluffy” content. We are looking for it to be accurate, medical or health based information that can be fact checked or provides real relevant information. We will be using SEO efforts with these blogs. Both Owners always work in humor and kindness into their work. Many of their clients are intimidated to work out, or uncomfortable. We would like the tone to be kind, informative, motivating, and easy to understand. We would like some blog pieces to answer questions, explain a subject, clarify a common misunderstanding, etc.
Since they have 4 target buyer personas, we will be needing blogs on a wide range of fitness topics. 
Things to avoid would be anything that has to do with Cross Fit, or fitness topics that would appeal to people who go to a large massive gym. We really want the value of 1:1 personal training, Small Group Training, focused attention by someone who knows what they are doing, etc. to come through.

“As our business has grown, we have had a lot of interest in our cupcakes in a jar from all over the United States,” said a spokesperson for the company. “Now, you can order cupcakes in a jar from anywhere.”

Sunflour Baking Company’s Cupcake in a Jar is fast becoming a hit with customers — so much so that orders are pouring in from as far away as Alaska and Hawaii. The Cupcake in a Jar features two cupcakes, including icing, in a reusable, recyclable mason jar. Flavors include Black and White, Blondie, Caramel, Carrot Cake, Chocolate Caramel and Classic Birthday. A host of other recipes are available, such as Key Lime, Chocolate Peanut Butter and German Chocolate. They are available in packs of two, four or six. They last for two weeks in the refrigerator and up to six months in the freezer. They are made from scratch and hand-packed.

Sunflour Baking Company has been serving Charlotte from its original Elizabeth location since 2009. The Dilworth location opened in 2016; the Harrisburg location opened just recently. Owned and operated by the Parrish family since 2014, Sunflour enjoys a love of baking, a passion for excellent service and a keen interest in contributing to the local community.

Ideally we would like to touch base on topics that prove why working with a creative agency is a great idea for businesses. We would like to target businesses who are looking to partner with our company and work with us for a variety of needs. We typically work with clients first on their web projects, and then that forms a great relationship where we know their brand, process, target clients, etc. We would really like to grow our client basis with people looking for a vendor who can help them with all their marketing - digital needs. Our current focused verticals are in the Automotive Space, Action Sports, Construction-Developer, and Cannabis industries. 

The owner Justin would only like to put out factual information that makes people think. He really likes statistics and loves explaining the ROI of good digital services. He has a passion for all things custom, and hates template websites and template solutions.  Scarlett Vision Media has developed their own CMS and offers amazing custom software solutions for all our clients. Some creative firms do not have strong knowledge in software, so we think this is a selling point for our firm.  Our owner is a bit sassy and loves humor and confidence to come through in 
his work. When someone reads our Blog we would like it to be relevant, useful topics that are specific. We don't like the content that says a lot, but doesn't really say anything. :) Hope that makes sense.

A close competitor in the same space (but w/ a different solution) is YourCause. Here is their blog: https://solutions.yourcause.com/blog/

Key highlights of our platform: 
-Allow employees to have access to Giving accounts
- Employers can add funds to the employee Givinga accounts and the employee can direct the funds to the 501(c)3 of their choice
-Employees can add money to their account through payroll deductions and receive a full tax write-off
-Employees can run crowdfunding campaigns to collect donations from external donors and amplify the amount given to their selected 501(c)3
-External donors to a campaign also get a tax write-off
- Employers are provided with full reporting that gives insight into how giving is taking place (how much money sent, which charities, etc.) 
- The platform allows for matching campaigns to be easily run and managed by the employers.

Key Themes For Corporations:
The Givinga platform combines financial tools w/ unique giving vehicles to: 1)  Create a new benefits & monetize giving 2) Empower workforce 3) Convert employees into Ambassadors 4) Reduce costs 5) Amplify Corporate Impact, all w/out increasing existing budget

Our target audience is C-level executives who already contribute to charity and encourage their employees to do the same but want to maximize their donations, streamline giving, get better ROI in the form of happy, loyal employees, etc.

UPDATE: NO TIME-SENSITIVE TOPICS PLEASE

IDEA1 is an apartment building located in the East Village near downtown San Diego. It’s a unique community that invites entrepreneurs, visionaries, and inspired professionals to live, work, and socialize. The average age of the primary market is upper 30’s, however, will span upper-twenty-somethings to mid 50’s and 60s. It has 295 apartments, commercial space, and collaborative workspaces. 

This is a new property that doesn’t have residents yet. It’s important to keep this in mind and not refer to residents directly. Lease up began in early August. Move-in dates are not confirmed yet.

We would like blog content that appeals to the residents who live in this community. Topics should be community focused and include local events, businesses, restaurants, monthly events,e tc.

The goal of the blog post is to highlight things to do or neighborhood hotspots in the area as an indirect way of showcasing the apartment community itself. Guidelines are as follows:

-Hyper-local: We would like all businesses to be found in the East Village neighborhood of San Diego. Neighboring areas in downtown (for example, Gaslamp Quarter) are also OK to write about if relevant to the property demographic.
-Local businesses/hotspots tailored for resident: Focus on new or interesting restaurants, bars, art galleries, unique stores, pop-ups, etc. in the East Village area.
-Link the apartment website: Link the provided apartment website to a relevant word/phrase. Be sure to include a mention/link to the apartments and end the post with a call-to-action statement (ie: contact us today to learn more!).

Things to avoid:
-Gyms and bike shops as the property already has these things
-Fast food restaurants//chain restaurants 
-Businesses/things that are not in East Village, San Diego
-Holiday or religious content
-If writing about a restaurant - do not just list out menu items and their ingredients. Go into more detail the atmosphere, fun facts about the restaurant etc.
-If writing about a business - do not just list services. Include fun facts, atmosphere, etc.
-Do not use the words “tenant” and “complex”. Instead use ""resident"" or ""community""

WHAT WE DO: In short it is an an end to end platform, from measuring where to spend down to a zip code level, programmatically creating the ads, buying through multiple channels and adjusting based off outcomes and revenue in your marketplace.

Because tamme integrates all the way from your analytics through to the impressions that users see tamme's able to gain a holistic picture of your marketplace.

All success measures are brought back to both moving users through funnel stages and final/repeat goal conversions, such as ordering a meal, booking a car or hiring a staff member.

Then all expenditure is measured back to simple unit economics:

i. ACV
ii. CAC
iii. CTS
iv. Churn rate
v. MRR
vi. CLV

This allows all marketing activities that tamme undertakes to be tied directly back to the core function of the business instead of being measured by vanity marketing metrics.

Currently we sell a seasonal bison box that is delivered straight to homes in British Columbia with beautiful recipes from Vancouver renown chef Chris Whittaker (his restaurant links are provided at the bottom). 

With what we’re putting into our body becoming more of a discussion around the kitchen table there is now a major focus on healthy food choices. This is why products like bison are now being easily substituted into a weekly diet. 

As a ranch we believe strongly in the importance of being environmentally conscious while delivery the best tasting and nutritionally beneficial meat. 

Blog Ideas:
What we're looking for from a writer is articles about why people should choose bison meat. This isn't just meant to be one article but many. Some explaining the health benefits (while not bashing other meat industries), environmental benefits, etc. 

Perhaps articles about famous chefs that have cooked with bison before and what they loved about it and what they cooked.

We're also open to other articles that can help highlight the history of these amazing animals and their environment. 

Any article that is beautifully written about the bison would be great.

Client Name: Harbour Rock	
Client Website: www.Harbour-Rock.com

About the Client:

Client Industry: Harbour Rock is an outsourced CFO firm and management advisory/consulting services. 

Company Information & Overview:  Harbour Rock offers a distinct alternative to establishing a full-time financial back office – you get responsive, efficient, and proactive financial management advisory or outsourced CFO services on an as-needed basis. We invest the time to understand your business so we can present innovative solutions that help you achieve your goals.

Target Persona of the Blogs: Board of Directors,  CEO, CIO, COO, CDO, CCO, VCs, HR professionals, CPAs

Target Audience of the Blogs: Blog readers are likely very established managers at the least, but most are C-level executives – predominately male – and in their 40s – 60s typically. They either lost their CFO due to quitting or firing, are being audited and need help, their accountant or bookkeeper is overwhelmed, their current financial team is struggling with reporting, they’re looking to expand their business geographically (overseas especially) or are a start-up and are looking for someone to step into the role. They’re very well educated, and are looking for insight – not to be sold. 

Tone of the Writing Style : The client is very relatable, friendly, and witty, but professional and intelligent. Spare writing that is full of jargon and filled with overwhelming words – we’re looking for content that is meaty, understandable, and easily digestible. Making a move to an outsourced CFO is a big move for any company, and is a relatively new idea- so we want prospects and business professionals to be comfortable and not feel overwhelmed. We want to earn trust and build a relationship at each turn of the road, and blogging is a big piece of this puzzle.

Objective of the Blog: We want prospects to be informed and educated. We do not want to sell, but rather be a resource to business and finance – and be a pillar for best practices, honesty, and insight.

Topics/Words to Avoid: We want to avoid politics, digging into conversation about the economy, snarkiness, sarcasm, and humor.  We also do not want to portray fear in the writing, especially as it relates to the fate of a company who is struggling or regarding the economy as a whole.

Topics/Words to Focus On: Our main keywords are management consulting services, outsourced CFOs, part-time CFOs, virtual CFOs, and fractional CFOs.

Trends do not look favorable, in the short term, for the Italian real estate market. Which is why many Italians are looking for similar investment opportunities abroad, especially in an economically stable country such as the United States.

Some of the reasons to invest in Miami are:

    Location and climate.
    Being an international tourist attraction and a refuge from colder climates results in high demand for second homes.
    Immigration from South America translates into high demand for first homes.
    Strong commercial appeal: Miami is a large US financial center (after NY) and is home to many companies that use it as a springboard to South America and the Caribbean. It is also an important commercial port and aviation hub for Central and South America.
    Favorable Euro to Dollar exchange rate.
    Highly profitable residential real estate market.
    Purchasing real estate in the South Florida market is affordable and the process is simple.
    Market trends continue to indicate growth in the near term.
    Low investment risk as another economic crisis in this region of the magnitude experienced in 2008 in very unlikely.
    Diverse investment opportunities for properties of all types and intended use (condominiums, detached houses, plots of land to be developed, whole residential and commercial buildings).
    Highly active market.
    Financing is easily available given the stability of the market.

The Miami real-estate market is growing and very active.

The average prices Increased by 16.1% to $ 244,000, the highest point since 2008. The average price per sqf Exceed $ 305 for the first time in five years. The days That a property remains on the market collapsed to 58, the lowest level since 2008.

In the first quarter of 2014 there was the highest number of sales over the past eight years as the inventory of apartments begins to increase to to. The number of sales in the first quarter rose by 3.9% (5,133) over the same quarter last year and Represents the highest number of sales for the first quarter of the last eight years. The inventory of homes for sale grew by 13.2% (12,664) Compared to a year ago, as rising prices Caused the INCREASE in homes for sale on the market.

The normal sales market share Reached the highest rate of the last four years, ie 69.4%. The volume of short sale and foreclosure continues to fall.

In Particular, sales of apartments in the apartment block were up 2% Compared to the same period last year and the number of apartments for sale has Increased even faster (8,846 apartments for sale), factored That has Caused a decline in the rate of market absorption.

In detached houses Increased by 7.1% in the number of sales and 12.2% in the number of homes for sale.

In Particular in South Beach, the average price of the apartments sales grew by 19.6% ($ 355,000).


Most property is easily rented at market price, with some exceptions depending on the building category.

Skyscrapers and large buildings in South Beach, Miami Beach, Downtown, Brickell, Bal Harbor, Aventura and Sunny Isles with luxurious facilities (pool, gym, valet parking, security, lobby, etc.)

    Benefits: Professional tenants with stable incomes and credentials.
    Disadvantages: High condo fees (with rare exceptions)
    Investment target: From $ 250.000- $ 300,000.
    Potential return: 6-7% before management fees and property tax (3-4% net).

Art Deco buildings in South Beach: low-rise buildings, built in the ’20s,’ 30s and ’40s, that have recently been completely renovated.

    Benefits: Long-term rentals (one year) and low condo fees, higher investment yield.
    Disadvantages: Tenant rating slightly lower.
    Investment target: From $ 200,000.
    Potential return: 6-7% before management fees and property tax (4-5% net).

Shop for appreciation: favorable contingency determined by the INCREASE in property prices in the Miami area and the recent, albeit slow, recovery of available financing by banks. The loan to value (financing on the price of purchase) is determined by the building and property being purchased. Financing for foreigners can usually cover up to 60% of the purchase price.

Luxury buildings (from $ 1,5mil): is a more conservative type of investment. Such investments can be made in skyscrapers and large buildings in established areas such as South Beach, Coral Gables, Aventura, Brickell, or in the purchase of entire buildings and Art Deco villas.

Buying Pre-construction: These long-term investments are plentiful. There are over 40+ new skyscrapers under construction in the Miami area.

    Benefits: 10% payment upon booking and by a further 20% in installments, balance the deed; two potential high profitability to the constant growth of the market
    Disadvantages: Sorting and screening of new projects is key. Risks associated with the builder and the long term market must be thoroughly evaluated. Usually condo conversions of Art Deco buildings involve almost no risk because the demand is so high that these units are normally sold out “on paper”.

My client avatar is a young (20s- early 30s) ambitious couple who doesn't settle for the status quo life. They are likely entrepreneurial minded and still in the early stages of their career. They have a great sense of humor and are grateful for the life they have. Also, super important, they are crazy in love and not just getting married because it is the next step. They also care more about WHO is at their wedding than what (details). Oh yeah, and they don't mind meeting up with me for a glass of wine every now and then!

We embrace the motto ""functional elegance"". Therefore, our bags are stylish but have lots of practical features.

Underlying all this is the following philosophy:

With our products, we aim to help parents to:
•	save time
•	be organised and
•	simplify and declutter their lives 
so that they can focus on what is important in life: 
•	their mental and physical well-being
•	their relationship with each other
•	spending time with their children and 
•	helping them grow into capable and loving adults

STYLE GUIDELINES

Spelling and terminology: 
We are a British company and would like to our copy to reflect our identity. We would prefer British spelling and terminology.  Please refer to the Oxford English Dictionary.

Tone:
We are trying to sell to millennial parents of young children. Within that group, our niche is those with busy lifestyles, those that favour practicality over form and do not have much time to waste.
To get the attention of our niche, our voice needs to be honest/realistic, direct and sticking to the facts while keeping it humorous and witty.

BUSINESS INFO ON QUICKALYTICS AND ABOUT MY BLOG ENTRY REQUESTS

ABOUT MY BUSINESS
My business is a single product business - web application (software program hosted on the web vs a desktop) called Quickalytics®.  Quickalytics is a HR Performance Management suite of tools offered on an an annual subscription basis (SAAS biz model). The business handles updating Quickalytics by rolling out new features on a bi-weekly basis, selling Quickalytics, and working hard to support our clients. 

WHO I SELL TO

I mostly sell to the executives of professional service firms, and more specifically to CPA (accounting) firms with 50 - 500 employees located in the United States. The firms often have different practices within them, but usually break into Audit, Tax, and sometimes Consulting practices with minimal support staff.  

Most employees are CPAs (or on their way to CPA licensure) with a very small percentage of employees in support functions (IT, Marketing, HR, Clerical).  In firms of 50, many of these support functions are taken on by practicing accountants in a dual role or outsourced completely.

The decision makers for a purchase of a subscription such as Quickalytics are the executives in consultation with the HR people (or people in those roles as they will most likely be the firm’s administrator of Quickalytics and responsible for it’s implementation in the firm.  

The larger of these firms are mostly managed by a Partner/Shareholder who is elected by the other partners to serve as a Firm Manager on a rotating basis.  Smaller firms, are usually run by the firm's founder, the owner and will make this decision in consultation with a partner or two.


MY THREE TYPES OF BLOG ENTRY REQUESTS

These blog entries (which will be placed on my website, and referenced in our newsletter):  
Provide these decision makers with a focused, relevant explanation of specific initiatives and other solutions to their firm’s needs.  
Provide these decision makers with focused, relevant info about a specific selection of solutions to issues their firms face; 
Provide these same decision makers (and maybe some support people) focused, relevant info on the how Quickalytics can put implementing these solutions within practical reach of their firm.

Initiative Background Explanatory Posts
 This group of posts will provide a background explanatory on initiatives so that if a firm wants to implement an initiative, they can get a quick, but well done sense of that what that initiative is, what it entails, and what it is used for.  Decision makers are busy either rainmaking for their firm, or managing it - often both.  When they don’t have the specific background on some of these things, these ‘explanatories’ will fill that gap.  

Examples:
Employee Engagement programs
What is Frequent Feedback?
Why implement an initiative to Identify Top and Emerging Talent?

Calls to Actions we will place at the end of the post:
Contact us link, 
To a post on how to specifically implement that initiative (see purpose 3 types below) with Quickalytics and
Possibly to a post doing a deeper dive on exactly how that initiative addresses certain issues (see Purpose 2 below).

From Pain Points to Solutions Posts
This group of posts will be focused on educating on how a pain point can be specifically addressed with an initiative, or other solution type.  Unlike the Purpose 1 posts (above) which explain WHAT an initiative is, these posts will explain HOW implementing an initiative like this will address specific pain points.  They will discuss challenges to implementing, how these challenges are met, and what kinds of benefits to expect. 

Examples: 
Addressing Retention issues through employee engagement
Turning around a disengaged workforce leveraging frequent feedback
How ensuring alignment, leads to engaged employees
What if your top employees informally recommended your firm as preferred place to work? 
Ensure the right people are recognized and rewarded
Tired of watching fast trackers jump ship?  


At the end of the post, readers should want to contact us for a demo of our software, or feel compelled to explore more detail on the initiatives discussed.  Therefore, we will place the following CTAs at the end of these posts:
A Contact us link, 
Link to the Initiative implementation overview type post (see below), 
Link to Initiative background explanatory post to concertize their understanding of the initiative.

Initiative Implementation Overviews

These blog posts are for those that have decided they want to implement an initiative in their firm (because, what we wrote about addressing the pain points was compelling?)  So, they are coming here to understand what specifically is involved in actually implementing this initiative or program for their firm.  These are the posts where I will connect their solution to the qualities that make my product a good fit.  But, these will still be overviews, not product fact sheets. Instead, these will cover what needs to be done to successfully implement the initiative and what qualities are needed to make those implementations practical for a CPA firm to implement.  Lucky for me - Quickalytics has those specific qualities. :) 

Examples of various types of programs:
- Continuous Performance Improvement programs
- Frequent feedback programs
- Engagement programs
- Talent Management programs
- Retention programs
- Coaching and Mentoring programs
- Alignment Programs
- Goal Programs
- Management Effectiveness programs
- Reward and Recognition programs
- Etc

Various ways of making it practical (I'll provide specifics per topic):
- Focus the task to what's essential
- Work within the firm's workflows.  
- Drastically cut or eliminate administrative tasks from what people are doing.
- Eliminate the need for any training
- Make it easy to leverage the results 6 ways from Sunday
- Allow the customization options to make the CPA firm 'fit' perfect

At the end of the post, readers should want to contact us for a demo of our software.  If not, they will want to view the Quick Start Implementation Guide for implementating this initiative. On the other hand, if they still don’t feel compelled, we will provide links back to the other 2 types of posts, or a request to sign up for our newsletter.   Therefore, we will place the following CTAs at the end of these posts:
A Contact us link
A link to a 2 page Quick Start Guide for implementing this initiative in Quickalytics.  
Links to relevant further reading to the other blog posts
A link to sign up for the newsletter. 
to the Initiative implementation overview type post (see below), 
Link to Initiative background



ABOUT MY BLOG AUDIENCE


The intended audience will be CPA firm managers or other executives along with some HR people.  A very large part of the Quickalytics branding is that we get things done effectively and transparently.  Therefore, the way the blog entries are written needs to reflect that attitude. Here's how I picture it.

When you write this, picture the CEO of a company reading these.  They are coming to this with a purpose in mind - not really a browse mentality.  If they like what they see they will forward info to someone else to follow up (more on that later). To make it easy for them to skim the content they will want, I think most posts should have:
- an executive summary (for a 600-900 words blog post, seriously? Yep!)
- clear supporting topic headings
- bullet points within the text of the body text
- some RELEVANT stats they can relate to
- a clear summary

They are reading for 2 purposes:

1)  Does the value proposition make sense? As an example  - Is frequent feedback something I want for my firm? What would I expect the outcome to be for the firm? Is that worth it? Will the time/money invested in implementing a frequent feedback initiative (for instance) make sense?

2) Does Quickalytics (the firm and the software look like it can deliver? If the blog post is written authoritatively and tracks with their reality, then they will think so.  If I get them to the demo, I can prove it. My goal is to get them to know it will be worth the time to get someone to give them a call to set up a demo.



BLOG STYLE GUIDE

TITLES:  I will ‘seed’ with a title to explain what I am looking for, but I would love it if you would also suggest a few (better) titles to go with your blog post.  

TONE/VOICE:
Executive conversational.  Imagine the tone and voice when CPA firm presidents are talking to each other. 

OVERALL BLOG STYLE
I expect my audience to read in this way: 
They will read the title.
Next, they will read the executive summary (at the top)
Next they will skim through the H2, H3, H4 headings
Next, they will read the summary
Finally, they will read all the way through the blog post. 

Title →  Executive Summary → skim by Reading Headlines/Topic headings→ Summary → Read through blog → CTA.  

Please confirm the readability of the blog post when you are done, to make sure that it’ll make sense and be pleasant to read this way to the reader at each step. They should feel a progression.  The takeaway is that they should get the biggest takeaway as soon as possible.

HEADINGS
Please take advantage of the 3 additional heading sizes (after the title). Title = H1, and then use H2, H3 and H4 headings.  
Please label which header level you are intending for each heading by putting H2, H3, or H4 prior to each heading. (example: H2: USING QUICKALYTICS )

SECTION LENGTHS
Article Titles: <9 words
Executive summary: ~ 5 sentences
Headlines/Topic headings: Max 10 words
(Ending) Summary: 50-150 words (not including our CTA info)
Blog Body: In general keep paragraphs from 1 to 5 sentences

BLOG POST STRUCTURES FOR VARIOUS TYPES

Provide some examples of what goes into implementing this kind of implementation? Who’s involved, what are the roles, how do things progress, how can you tell if things are going well (or not)? What things should you make sure are in place to maximize the odds of success?

BUSINESS INFO ON QUICKALYTICS AND ABOUT MY BLOG ENTRY REQUESTS

ABOUT MY BUSINESS
My business is a single product business - web application (software program hosted on the web vs a desktop) called Quickalytics®.  Quickalytics is a HR Performance Management suite of tools offered on an an annual subscription basis (SAAS biz model). The business handles updating Quickalytics by rolling out new features on a bi-weekly basis, selling Quickalytics, and working hard to support our clients. 

WHO I SELL TO

I mostly sell to the executives of professional service firms, and more specifically to CPA (accounting) firms with 50 - 500 employees located in the United States. The firms often have different practices within them, but usually break into Audit, Tax, and sometimes Consulting practices with minimal support staff.  

Most employees are CPAs (or on their way to CPA licensure) with a very small percentage of employees in support functions (IT, Marketing, HR, Clerical).  In firms of 50, many of these support functions are taken on by practicing accountants in a dual role or outsourced completely.

The decision makers for a purchase of a subscription such as Quickalytics are the executives in consultation with the HR people (or people in those roles as they will most likely be the firm’s administrator of Quickalytics and responsible for it’s implementation in the firm.  

The larger of these firms are mostly managed by a Partner/Shareholder who is elected by the other partners to serve as a Firm Manager on a rotating basis.  Smaller firms, are usually run by the firm's founder, the owner and will make this decision in consultation with a partner or two.


MY THREE TYPES OF BLOG ENTRY REQUESTS

These blog entries (which will be placed on my website, and referenced in our newsletter):  
Provide these decision makers with a focused, relevant explanation of specific initiatives and other solutions to their firm’s needs.  
Provide these decision makers with focused, relevant info about a specific selection of solutions to issues their firms face; 
Provide these same decision makers (and maybe some support people) focused, relevant info on the how Quickalytics can put implementing these solutions within practical reach of their firm.

Initiative Background Explanatory Posts
 This group of posts will provide a background explanatory on initiatives so that if a firm wants to implement an initiative, they can get a quick, but well done sense of that what that initiative is, what it entails, and what it is used for.  Decision makers are busy either rainmaking for their firm, or managing it - often both.  When they don’t have the specific background on some of these things, these ‘explanatories’ will fill that gap.  

Examples:
Employee Engagement programs
What is Frequent Feedback?
Why implement an initiative to Identify Top and Emerging Talent?

Calls to Actions we will place at the end of the post:
Contact us link, 
To a post on how to specifically implement that initiative (see purpose 3 types below) with Quickalytics and
Possibly to a post doing a deeper dive on exactly how that initiative addresses certain issues (see Purpose 2 below).

From Pain Points to Solutions Posts
This group of posts will be focused on educating on how a pain point can be specifically addressed with an initiative, or other solution type.  Unlike the Purpose 1 posts (above) which explain WHAT an initiative is, these posts will explain HOW implementing an initiative like this will address specific pain points.  They will discuss challenges to implementing, how these challenges are met, and what kinds of benefits to expect. 

Examples: 
Addressing Retention issues through employee engagement
Turning around a disengaged workforce leveraging frequent feedback
How ensuring alignment, leads to engaged employees
What if your top employees informally recommended your firm as preferred place to work? 
Ensure the right people are recognized and rewarded
Tired of watching fast trackers jump ship?  


At the end of the post, readers should want to contact us for a demo of our software, or feel compelled to explore more detail on the initiatives discussed.  Therefore, we will place the following CTAs at the end of these posts:
A Contact us link, 
Link to the Initiative implementation overview type post (see below), 
Link to Initiative background explanatory post to concertize their understanding of the initiative.

Initiative Implementation Overviews

These blog posts are for those that have decided they want to implement an initiative in their firm (because, what we wrote about addressing the pain points was compelling?)  So, they are coming here to understand what specifically is involved in actually implementing this initiative or program for their firm.  These are the posts where I will connect their solution to the qualities that make my product a good fit.  But, these will still be overviews, not product fact sheets. Instead, these will cover what needs to be done to successfully implement the initiative and what qualities are needed to make those implementations practical for a CPA firm to implement.  Lucky for me - Quickalytics has those specific qualities. :) 

Examples of various types of programs:
- Continuous Performance Improvement programs
- Frequent feedback programs
- Engagement programs
- Talent Management programs
- Retention programs
- Coaching and Mentoring programs
- Alignment Programs
- Goal Programs
- Management Effectiveness programs
- Reward and Recognition programs
- Etc

Various ways of making it practical (I'll provide specifics per topic):
- Focus the task to what's essential
- Work within the firm's workflows.  
- Drastically cut or eliminate administrative tasks from what people are doing.
- Eliminate the need for any training
- Make it easy to leverage the results 6 ways from Sunday
- Allow the customization options to make the CPA firm 'fit' perfect

At the end of the post, readers should want to contact us for a demo of our software.  If not, they will want to view the Quick Start Implementation Guide for implementating this initiative. On the other hand, if they still don’t feel compelled, we will provide links back to the other 2 types of posts, or a request to sign up for our newsletter.   Therefore, we will place the following CTAs at the end of these posts:
A Contact us link
A link to a 2 page Quick Start Guide for implementing this initiative in Quickalytics.  
Links to relevant further reading to the other blog posts
A link to sign up for the newsletter. 
to the Initiative implementation overview type post (see below), 
Link to Initiative background



ABOUT MY BLOG AUDIENCE


The intended audience will be CPA firm managers or other executives along with some HR people.  A very large part of the Quickalytics branding is that we get things done effectively and transparently.  Therefore, the way the blog entries are written needs to reflect that attitude. Here's how I picture it.

When you write this, picture the CEO of a company reading these.  They are coming to this with a purpose in mind - not really a browse mentality.  If they like what they see they will forward info to someone else to follow up (more on that later). To make it easy for them to skim the content they will want, I think most posts should have:
- an executive summary (for a 600-900 words blog post, seriously? Yep!)
- clear supporting topic headings
- bullet points within the text of the body text
- some RELEVANT stats they can relate to
- a clear summary

They are reading for 2 purposes:

1)  Does the value proposition make sense? As an example  - Is frequent feedback something I want for my firm? What would I expect the outcome to be for the firm? Is that worth it? Will the time/money invested in implementing a frequent feedback initiative (for instance) make sense?

2) Does Quickalytics (the firm and the software look like it can deliver? If the blog post is written authoritatively and tracks with their reality, then they will think so.  If I get them to the demo, I can prove it. My goal is to get them to know it will be worth the time to get someone to give them a call to set up a demo.



BLOG STYLE GUIDE

TITLES:  I will ‘seed’ with a title to explain what I am looking for, but I would love it if you would also suggest a few (better) titles to go with your blog post.  

TONE/VOICE:
Executive conversational.  Imagine the tone and voice when CPA firm presidents are talking to each other. 

OVERALL BLOG STYLE
I expect my audience to read in this way: 
They will read the title.
Next, they will read the executive summary (at the top)
Next they will skim through the H2, H3, H4 headings
Next, they will read the summary
Finally, they will read all the way through the blog post. 

Title →  Executive Summary → skim by Reading Headlines/Topic headings→ Summary → Read through blog → CTA.  

Please confirm the readability of the blog post when you are done, to make sure that it’ll make sense and be pleasant to read this way to the reader at each step. They should feel a progression.  The takeaway is that they should get the biggest takeaway as soon as possible.

HEADINGS
Please take advantage of the 3 additional heading sizes (after the title). Title = H1, and then use H2, H3 and H4 headings.  
Please label which header level you are intending for each heading by putting H2, H3, or H4 prior to each heading. (example: H2: USING QUICKALYTICS )

SECTION LENGTHS
Article Titles: <9 words
Executive summary: ~ 5 sentences
Headlines/Topic headings: Max 10 words
(Ending) Summary: 50-150 words (not including our CTA info)
Blog Body: In general keep paragraphs from 1 to 5 sentences

BLOG POST STRUCTURES FOR VARIOUS TYPES

- some RELEVANT stats they can relate to
- a clear summary

They are reading for 2 purposes:

1)  Does the value proposition make sense? As an example  - Is frequent feedback something I want for my firm? What would I expect the outcome to be for the firm? Is that worth it? Will the time/money invested in implementing a frequent feedback initiative (for instance) make sense?

2) Does Quickalytics (the firm and the software look like it can deliver? If the blog post is written authoritatively and tracks with their reality, then they will think so.  If I get them to the demo, I can prove it. My goal is to get them to know it will be worth the time to get someone to give them a call to set up a demo.



BLOG STYLE GUIDE

TITLES:  I will ‘seed’ with a title to explain what I am looking for, but I would love it if you would also suggest a few (better) titles to go with your blog post.  

TONE/VOICE:
Executive conversational.  Imagine the tone and voice when CPA firm presidents are talking to each other. 

OVERALL BLOG STYLE
I expect my audience to read in this way: 
They will read the title.
Next, they will read the executive summary (at the top)
Next they will skim through the H2, H3, H4 headings
Next, they will read the summary
Finally, they will read all the way through the blog post. 

Title →  Executive Summary → skim by Reading Headlines/Topic headings→ Summary → Read through blog → CTA.  

Please confirm the readability of the blog post when you are done, to make sure that it’ll make sense and be pleasant to read this way to the reader at each step. They should feel a progression.  The takeaway is that they should get the biggest takeaway as soon as possible.

HEADINGS
Please take advantage of the 3 additional heading sizes (after the title). Title = H1, and then use H2, H3 and H4 headings.  
Please label which header level you are intending for each heading by putting H2, H3, or H4 prior to each heading. (example: H2: USING QUICKALYTICS )

SECTION LENGTHS
Article Titles: <9 words
Executive summary: ~ 5 sentences
Headlines/Topic headings: Max 10 words
(Ending) Summary: 50-150 words (not including our CTA info)
Blog Body: In general keep paragraphs from 1 to 5 sentences

Whether students are looking to save money on student loans, reach that next career goal or invest in their future, Study Loans works to help our customers reach their potential.

Study Loans was born out of the frustration with the current government funded system. Having witnessed first-hand, the difficulty students faced with accessing funds and the constant changes in the rules, we felt it was about time a private business stepped in to provide an alternative. We believe education is critically important to society, but also the future prosperity of individuals, however education can be expensive.

Our Products

There is something magical about phosphorescent materials and while the initial concept was to bring glow in the dark to canvas and other fine art, we quickly ended up with an assortment of unique, quality pieces of glow in the dark art from around the world. From our glowing glass to our glowing sand pictures, nearly every one of our products is inspired by art, science, or nature.

In addition to our gallery of amazing art pieces, we also sell glow in the dark paint and pigment so that you can create your own works of art.  Star murals, blown glass, jewelry, resin casting, model painting, and more are all possible uses for our line of paints and powders.

Our Technology

All of our products are made with the newest generation of glow in the dark materials which glow 10 times brighter and much longer than the more common and less expensive zinc sulfide technology.  Also, every one of our glow in the dark powders are encapsulated so that they can be used in either solvent or water base mediums without degrading.

Our Goal

We want our blog to serve as an inspiration to artist on how they can use our products for their future projects. We want to educate them on the different uses of Glow Paint and Glow Powders by giving them ideas on different projects they can do with our products.

We want blog articles that will rank well within google for Glow Paint, Glow Powder, and Glow in the Dark Paints, Glow in Dark Powders. We want articles that not only educate but give specific project ideas they can use with our products.

In the work culture this blog is promoting, work is not just a place to get paid, or just develop work skills. It is a place to grow, get coached, develop new personal and professional skills, experiment, be creative, and be a part of something bigger than oneself. Ideas will be drawn from the psychology of purpose, human potential, and fulfillment. Each article should tie to a key benefit, for example increased innovation, employee retention, business growth, time management AND a key life benefit, connection, growth, fulfillment, etc.

The target audience is in their 30s, and manages a team of developers and designers at a Fortune 500 company. They are inspired by the idea of lifestyle design, and believe they can have it all: a fulfilling career, health, travel, relationships, and hobbies. They are driven by living and generating happiness, feeling satisfaction, exploring self-growth, and creating a culture of innovation. They work to fulfill a passion as much as to get paid.

Our aim is to get blue collar workers (light industrial, retail, etc) into jobs faster by working with staffing agencies to increase their efficiency using technology.
 
Our platform allows agencies to send messages to workers with the job details the agencies have. This saves them from having to call each worker, share the job requirements and have lengthy conversations with people who may not be qualified/ interested/able to get to the job.

We can send messages via bulk-sms, email or through an app that we white-label for the agency (think whatsapp/messenger but with the agency's logo on it).

We want our blog content to do two things:
1) appeal to the staffing agency recruiters showing them how our platform makes it easier for them to connect with their candidates.
2) appeal to the staffing agency owners showing them that they'll save money/time by using technology to align their agency with the shift to the gig economy.

We are creating algorithms that use the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence, Machine and Deep Learning. Our software is currently geared towards Sales and Marketing departments at Fortune 500 and mid-sized companies. 
We created an Artificially Intelligent Sales Assistant that is able to hold conversations in English over email. Our customers are using our technology inside their Sales/Marketing Department. There, our conversational semantic email-engine reads and responds to email from leads. 
Example: A website visitor fills out a webform, leaving his email address, and says ""I'm interested in your product"". Our AI-Assistant picks up that signal (email message), reads it, understands its content and engages the lead with an email response. This back and forth conversations goes on until the lead is ready to buy. At that moment, the AI hands off this lead to an actual human salesperson so that the human can go in and close the deal and sign up that customer.

We think that AI will replace a lot of jobs in the future and free mankind up to do more exciting/fun/higher-value tasks.

Similar dental hygiene sites include Modern Hygienist, RDH Magazine, and Dimensions of Dental Hygiene, if you want to check those websites out. 

What I’m looking for is a weekly write-up of a current dental research topic or study that comes out that week. For example, research showing links of oral bacteria to other bodily diseases (i.e. heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis), newest protocols (i.e. ultrasonic scaling), things along these lines but definitely not limited to these examples. The more dental hygiene-related, the better. Whether the research is from PubMed, dental journals, or science journals like Scientific American, for example, I need about a 400-600 word summary of emerging research which then can link back to the original content.

The main persona I would like to target is the construction business owner and/or controller.  The ideal customer runs about $20 million a year in projects, is using multiple systems to run their business, such as a different accounting app, project mgmt app, use spreadsheets, and other software.  This is a  big problem because all that data from all the systems has to tie back into the accounting for the business.  

Accubuild is one system that covers the needs of the construction business.  We also understand that every business is unique and no one software could possible cover 100% of how a business runs.  For this, we actually will modify our code and provide specific features to customers that streamline their business processes.

Several pain points for our target audience are: multiple systems to run their business, labor time collecting and reporting (this is a big problem), ability to manage their business from anywhere, and not knowing where their business is financially at a moments notice.

It's not Fiat, Skoda, Renault or Ford.

We develop the software at our 200-people strong HQ in Dortmund, Germany, and sell via a network of suppliers around the globe.
We have a name for being a little bit quirky (not quite such corporate slaves) and that our software is ""fresh"".

We've been going over 22 years, were the first guys who introduced GUI-based (windows/graphics) systems to hotels, where many were still using old DOS systems, or even still the old register books...
We also introduced the first mobile check-in software on the iPhone (and subsequent iPad), ran the Olympic Villages on our software for 2 consecutive Summer Games (2004 Athens, 2008 Beijing), and have recently been the first to deploy a true ""Hotel Operating System"", allowing hotels to plug and play the various software components they need for their businesses in much the same way as Apple/Android have their own marketplace for Apps.

There are also process-change notification features that aid in compliance needs for outsourced agents. 

We are still solidifying our messages, but we would like to be a source of support and information for any managers, leaders, trainers to help them improve what they do.

Basically we're like a life nanny -- we make your life and your work play nicely. (Think Ann Hathaway's character in The Devil Wears Prada.) We answer phones, write their emails, manage their calendars, book their travel, automate their grocery shopping, and we create systems to help their lives be more efficient, practical, and streamlined. 

Our clients are fans of things that make life EASIER, like ""lifehacks"", especially when it's things like scheduling. 

This blog was awesomely received because it was full of tips. My/our audience loves tips and actual resources. The best content is actionable. 
http://www.charissamoore.com/blog/break-the-social-binge

I also love this one http://www.charissamoore.com/blog/productive-days because it makes it really easy for our audience to get tips and tricks on what they can do to be more productive. 

Think about how Apple thinks of everything when they make the new iPhone. That's how we make our clients feel. So if we had content that could make them feel really capable, in control, and in charge of their lives, we'd be able to help their lives be better. (That's a great thing to do!)

Our blog is read by freelancers (whether VAs or not), who want to make their lives more efficient. We've generally stuck to the following topic areas: time management, productivity, small business systems, remote work, and delegation.

Like many other parents, we were exhausted trying to find a way to protect our kids from the dangers of the internet. When we were growing up, the biggest issue our parents faced was to make sure we did not hog the phone too long, or watch too much television! Well, how times have changed! Now, it seems that every home contraption is internet enabled. Kids have phones and tablets that can reach anything and anyone.
After 12 months of testing and programming, along with countless nights of researching and coding, we created something that we believe, does not currently exist - a simple, affordable, and transparent cloud service that can be installed on an Apple device to give a parent control and peace of mind!
Launched in early 2014, our first service, NetSanity Mobile Service for Apple, is based on the popular Apple iOS 7 & 8 platform. With NetSanity Mobile, parents will be able to purchase a device license, install it on their child’s Apple mobile device, and control internet access from their private and secure admin portal. Features like blocking internet apps, content filtering while browsing, scheduling when kids can use the phone – all these and more are included in the initial release of the service.

Not an App! Works in the background and is transparent. Our service is totally different and revolutionary! Your child cannot remove it. Only parents can remove it. You manage everything from the convenient dashboard on our website. There is nothing like it and your first 7 days are free!

Remember – we use the services just as you do. Our kids are protected and they are our best and worst critics!

Now offering service for Android (Samsung) Users as well!

Our first brand is KZ Gear: kzgear.com

KZ Gear is a sunglass company, focusing on an adventure lifestyle. We believe in supporting a community of people that want to go out and experience all that life has available to them 

Our client base ranges from college students to young professionals to younger families, rough age bracket of 18-42. We are building a social media community of individuals who are active, enjoy being outdoors, and spending time with friends and family. 

Our major areas of focus on outdoor activity are: 

On the water - we offer a line of floatable sunglasses and accessories to protect valuables from the water (phone cases, even water proof solar chargers). We focus a lot on time on and around the water and activities related to the beach, ocean, lakes, fishing, boating, skiing, etc.

Hiking and climbing - we also promote exploring the world around us while hiking and climbing. Many of our ambassadors are very active using GoPro's, drones, etc to capture beautiful landscapes and their adventures in the mountains, through the deserts, and jumping off things into water. 
In the winter, we see a lot with snow skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling, and even just snowball fights. We offer a line of ski goggles and beanies as well as other winter accessories for enjoying cold activities, but all the while promoting that social aspect. 

We are also moving into the everyday, the urban explorer, finding things to do in the city. These are for people who enjoy going to sporing events, want to find the hole-in-the-wall restaurant that everyone is talking about. They enjoy going to concerts and taking in all that their city or town has to offer

Our second brand is Science of Skill. scienceofskill.com

Science of Skill promotes a knowledge base and library as well as supporting products for those who want to be able to survive through a variety of scenarios. We primarily focus on 3 key components: 

Outdoor - hiking, camping, fishing, hunting. These are the people who enjoy going out and roughing it. Some are weekend warriors, others are sharing the trip with family and/or friends. They are sleeping in tents, cooking their own food, have brought the right tools to survive for the weekend, because that is what they find fun. They have the right gear, but they are not traveling in an RV. 

Survival - expanding on the last category, these individuals are prepared at home as well. They want to have the right tools and knowledge to be able to protect themselves and their families in case of an intruder or a disaster. They are NOT, extreme preppers or thinking The Walking Dead is going to happen next year. 

They like having the best gear, they have every day carry items on them like a knife, a multi tool, an RFID protected wallet, a first aid kit in the car, etc. They are prepared, but not extreme.

Post themes could include best breakfast spots, upcoming festivals (for an older crowd) within the next month, nearby restaurants etc. 

When choosing an event, pick events that are at least 14 days out from when you submit your post.

Our first product is a social media tool that makes it easy for group members to keep track of and boost each other on social media and in blog comments.

We need several blog posts written for our launch.

We need standard-length (550-650 words) to long pieces (850-950 words) that fall into the following formats:
- lists (top 10 books, top 10 tech tools, 5 people to follow, etc.)
- how-to's (how to use gamification to keep your group engaged, etc.)
- advice/info (why supporting individuals in your group matters as much as the group's overall objectives, why personal networks will be even more important in the future, etc.)
- case studies of successful interest groups and personal networks 
- your suggestions here!

We're addressing under-served communities. We want to meet them where they are. They have limited resources and no material or societal advantages, so they don't want advice or stories that require or involve such advantages.

Stories and examples that reflect the people we're addressing are great. 
The problem we're solving for our user is the challenge of keeping a group or small network together and mutually beneficial after the initial rush of forming the group has worn off. 

We're blatantly socially liberal. We're loudly pro women, pro African American,  pro LGBTQ, pro Native American, pro equal rights for all communities who are currently under-served by the system.",600,Basic - 600 words,Software,0,4,0,expired,2017-11-06T00:00:00.000-07:00,2018-02-21T00:00:00.000-07:00,120

We are creating algorithms that use the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence, Machine and Deep Learning. Our software is currently geared towards Sales and Marketing departments at Fortune 500 and mid-sized companies. 
We created an Artificially Intelligent Sales Assistant that is able to hold conversations in English over email. Our customers are using our technology inside their Sales/Marketing Department. There, our conversational semantic email-engine reads and responds to email from leads. 
Example: A website visitor fills out a webform, leaving his email address, and says ""I'm interested in your product"". Our AI-Assistant picks up that signal (email message), reads it, understands its content and engages the lead with an email response. This back and forth conversations goes on until the lead is ready to buy. At that moment, the AI hands off this lead to an actual human salesperson so that the human can go in and close the deal and sign up that customer.

We think that AI will replace a lot of jobs in the future and free mankind up to do more exciting/fun/higher-value tasks.

We are home improvement and decor experts.  Readers of our publication come to us for trustworthy, entertaining, relatable information about remodeling, fixing, improving, decorating, organizing, cleaning, and shopping for supplies for their biggest investments — their homes! Our readers also look for gardening guidance, ecofriendly solutions, product recommendations, buying/selling information, and household hacks.

Please note: We will NOT purchase posts that offer inaccurate or amateurish advice or cite non-credible sources, or posts that contain info that is obviously ""scraped"" from other sites. We expect your post to be well researched, authoritative, friendly and ORIGINAL.

What Kinds of Content Does The Money Pit Publish?

We are open to publishing:
* Well-researched, service-driven articles (either evergreen or newsy/seasonal)
* Personal essays that teach a lesson or provide helpful information
* Step-by-step projects, especially those with accompanying photos
* Roundups of shorter tips

What Is the Tone/Voice of The Money Pit Content?
* MoneyPit.com publishes content with an authoritative yet accessible voice and tone. Our content is not preachy; it is confident. We pride ourselves on giving our content a “face,” so feel free to let your personal voice shine through. The more relatable your words sound, the better!
* Content should never sound condescending or judgmental.

Content for The Money Pit should:
* Be 100% original and not published anywhere else.
* Be well written, clear, interesting, and above all, helpful.
* Have a logical structure and flow.
* Use subheadings and bullets/lists, where appropriate, to make it easy for the reader to consume the information.
* Include a strong, compelling introduction and a conclusion that wraps up the article or provides a call to action.
* Attribute all data, quotes, and referenced content by hyperlinking to the original source.
* Be between 400 and 600 words; however, don’t sacrifice depth for brevity.
* Avoid overly promotional information. You can use a company as an an example, but it should be used as the basis for sharing knowledge. 

Style Tip: We often use a problem-solution formula when writing (or broadcasting). First talk we point out the “pain point” or problem, and we try to do so in a fun and relatable way.  Then, we present the solution.  For example, if we were writing about an oven cleaning tip, we might open with:

""You know that charred layer of crud representing all that’s left of your last 6 months of baking? Well it turns out that crud may he chock full something you’d not want to serve up in your next meal, bacteria!  Using a baking bag instead not only will put those memories of past pies and pot roast behind you, your oven will also be a lot safer for you and your family!""

Make sense?  Tell the reader about a problem in a fun and relatable way, and then solve it!


Finally...

* Links are encouraged.  Because home improvement can be very visual, including links in your story to examples of similar solutions, products, techniques or just for more information, can be very helpful for the reader.

* IMPORTANT: Please search MoneyPit.com to make sure we don’t already have a post similar (or identical!) to the one you’re writing, or for our Preferred Writers, before you pitch us a topic.  We respect your time and talent and don't like turning down otherwise well written posts because we have similar/identical content.  You can certainly refresh or build upon a story on the site, but please make sure it brings new value to the topic.  

And because WordPress has a notoriously poor search tool, you'll get a better, faster and more accurate search by using the Google ""site:"" command.  Just type ""site:moneypit.com"" followed by the term you are searching for and Google will return only content on moneypit.com for that search 

Thanks again for your interest and we can't wait to see your posts!

You are not going to find our gym members using treadmills or spin bikes.  Instead, people come to group workouts in small class sizes.  Think CrossFit without the weights or a more intense version of yoga but without the mats.  The video above gives a great visual of all this.

2)	Only gym in Houston (and possibly Texas) focused on calisthenics.
3)	Personalized workout program.  Mekanix works with each full time member to understand their goals and personalize a workout program.  Because workouts consist of movements that can be easily adjusted to make them easier to harder, athletes can use their personalized program within normal classes to progress towards their goals.  
4)	Goal oriented workouts with a clear path of progression.

1. To build our brand identity

I want Blackburn Coastal Realty to be positioned in the minds of:

•	Beach and beach-adjacent property owners as a real estate company that is focused on getting Top Dollar for its client properties by looking beyond the numbers to behavioral economics to bewitch buyers by making each property look like an HGTV showcase.
•	Local realtors as a real estate brokerage with only full-time professional realtors (not hobbyists) that truly know the market (particularly beach and waterfront), are not sloppy/do not half-ass it, whose listed properties are a pleasure to show, are pleasant to work with but not saps, can hold their own in negotiations without playing games, think outside the box with creative solutions to transaction snags, and always, always, always seem to be one step ahead with our content, listing marketing, and incorporation of technology in our business.
•	In the minds of Homebuyers as realtors with the inside story on properties and market trends, who fight for every penny on the buyer’s behalf.

...and can demonstrate it because of our original take on things, on the market, our focus on behavioral economics rather than numbers alone (home buyers buy with emotion/limbic system but justify their purchase using logic).  and can help them avoid costly errors (potential lawsuits). In other words, we make them more $ with higher sales prices while saving them $ that would have come out of their net proceeds. <<I don’t mean we discount our commission – we never discount our commission because even at full commission, we are underpaid for all we bring to the table - hiring me at full commission costs homeowners way less than hiring a discount broker.>>

When Realtors talk about their length of experience what they actually give is the # of years they’ve had a real estate license. What they don’t say is that the majority are hobbyists who do less than 1 transaction per year and have another primary income source (salaried full-time job, spousal income). So when an agent says “I’ve been in this business for 20 years” it means they have completed fewer than 20 transactions. I’ve worked full time as a realtor for 10 solid years. That means hundreds of transactions, thousands of valuable lessons that my clients benefit from. This is how I pay my bills. And real estate is a living, breathing thing. Markets fluctuate all the time, things change all the time, NAR and FAR and local RE boards change the documents all the time. If it’s been 12 months since you’ve done a transaction, there are customs that have changed (eg using the As Is instead of the regular contract) that leave unsuspecting homeowners vulnerable.
 
2. Real estate is an incredibly competitive field, and we need to make sure we stay ahead of the pack.

People prefer to do business with brands they know, and my blog is the perfect tool for letting people get to know me/us, get to know our brand. 64% of sellers who used a real estate agent found their agents through a referral by friends or family. Just someone they know. 

Because so many of the beach properties are 2nd homes and the owners live elsewhere, when it’s time to sell, they don’t ask a neighbor for a recommendation. They go online. I want to use blogging to become their digital Realtor-next-door, a trusted source. I want to stay top-of-mind so when they do sell, I’m the first person they think of.

We’ve lived in this part of Florida for 30+ years, but only lived at the beach for the last twelve years, so we don’t have the advantage of being the neighborhood Realtor who’s had 100s of yard signs over dozens of years. (note: with so many condos at the beach, most of the time we don’t get the opportunity to reinforce our brand with yard signs). An advantage we have over the entrenched Realtor-next-door types is that they are not tech savvy and some even resist technology. One guy, in particular, comes to mind. He refuses to text. We’re early adopters of tech. 

We’re educated (I have a Bachelor’s degree in Marketing & 2 home staging certs, Bill has his JD, we sharpen our knowledge and skills every single day), creative, specialists in understanding what buyers want. Also with out of town sellers, we take care of everything for them. We are their eyes and ears. If their house needs painting before listing, we find and supervise the painters. When a light bulb goes out, we change it. 

3. I want to create a personal connection with our blog’s readers.

I want our blogs to feel as if we are speaking directly to the reader and I want to blog about topics homeowners want to read about, such as___________. Speak directly to them, one-to-one, not from a detached perch.
I want to hit them in two stages of the home selling or buying process: research/info gathering and comparison/narrowing down which realtor to hire

4. Original content will make our business stand out and help us gain more trust than our competitors.

No one local is posting the type of content our audience wants to read. That audience is made up of people successful enough (usually in business, as entrepreneurs or high level corporate) to afford to spend $500,000 (usually cash) on a property they’ll use for a few weeks or months of the year. They’re educated, worldly, well-read, savvy consumers.

If our content gives readers information they want to see, they’ll associate our brand with that information. I want them to think there is no better place to learn about real estate and homeownership than us. And that we’re the best option for home selling advice.

To stand out, we have to say something different than other Realtors – to share valuable, one-of-a-kind information they won’t find anywhere else on the internet. Things that make them have “AHA” moments, like “I never thought of it that way” or “that makes perfect sense” or “I always wondered why that was and now I know”. Information that, even if it didn’t answer the exact question they had when they started searching the internet, did give them the valuable info they didn’t realize they needed and positioned us in their brains as a Realtor that probably has the answers for all their home selling questions. I want our blog to be so good that our prospective and past clients become ambassadors for our brand, by sharing our posts on social media. 

I do NOT want the type of fluffy, mindless, generic, poorly written or self-aggrandizing posts I see other Realtors running (I say running because I don’t think most other Realtors are actually writing their own content. I think they are using recycled or “borrowed” content or an inexpensive generic Realtor blog product). If we post the same articles as our competitors, then we’re not offering our audience value. And they’ll assume we’re no better than any other realtor.

Most agents are high school graduates, but a college education is rare, which might not show itself in conversation, but it definitely shows in their writing. The composition of emails I get from other agents? I know 10-year olds who write better! Substandard English, used by people who claim English as their only language – using the wrong words, poor grammar, screwed up syntax, is fingernails on a chalkboard for my target audience. And me.

5. I want to use our blog posts to generate organic traffic to our site and increase # of sign-ups for building our pipeline



ABOUT US:
Sellers love us because we understand what Buyers are looking for. We use that knowledge to help homeowners ready their properties for sale. Whether that means selecting a team for painting, clean-up, repairs, arranging for professional photographs or personally staging the interior & exterior to make the home look great & sell well...we do all the legwork, which is especially helpful for out-of-town owners. We treat each property like a product on a shelf & make it stand out next to the competition.

To get Top Dollar for our Sellers, we know we need to generate the maximum number of Buyer Showings. The more Qualified Buyers who see a property, the higher the likelihood of healthy offers. To that end, we use all of the current day Media to market your property...email campaigns, keyword-based websites, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, messaging, signs, direct mail, open houses and all of the available real estate portals like Realtor.com, ListingBook, Homes.com, Zillow & Trulia. We expose your property to millions of Buyers worldwide!

Properties sell quickly if priced correctly. In order to know where to set that price, we do extensive research prior to listing. Part of determining the correct price for your home involves taking a look at similar homes that have sold recently and doing a Comparable Market Analysis (CMA). That's as far as most Realtors go, but in today's rapidly changing marketplace, it is also important to consider the current market conditions. What else is available for sale right now? Those are the properties Buyers will compare yours to and we use that information to create a pricing & positioning strategy. Selling property is all about positioning. Your house doesn't have to be THE BEST HOUSE EVER. It just has to appear equal to or better than the alternatives.

We don't just LIST properties -- we SELL them!

For Buyers, the first thing we do is Listen. We listen to what Buyers say (and don't say) about their preferences and must-haves. With this information, we pinpoint homes that meet those criteria, then continue to refine our searches based on Buyers' reactions to homes we show them. We are in daily contact with our Buyers -- immediately notifying them of new listings or price changes and educating them about things they will encounter in the home buying process (i.e., inspection, appraisal). Buyers moving from out-of-state love us because we know the area so well and because we use videos and FaceTime to keep those Buyers in the loop during every stage of the home buying process.

Homes that are well maintained and reasonably priced go under contract very quickly. That's why it's important to work with a Realtor who works full time in the business. Most agents are part-time, which limits their availability for anything from showings to answering questions and their power to help Buyers react quickly when bargain properties hit the market.

Once we find the perfect home, we guide Buyers through the negotiation process, contract paperwork, home inspection, financing, appraisal, final walk-thru & closing. Our agents are available via text, email, fax, or phone call so that they can take action on any issues or questions along the way.

Then, you turn the page and they tell you how Disney, Starbuck, Apple, or SAP used these techniques to grow. For 99% of the business out there, these processes don't apply. Companies with small marketing teams and realistic budget need special systems to grow. The business media lies to us by showing off how companies with huge budgets and tons of name recognition grow - because well-known names are sexy.

I grew my last company using 100% inbound leads from marketing. I was a team of one for a long time and we were not a funded company. That meant that i needed to figure this out on my own and use low-cost tools and processes to grow, or else I would not have a job. Ultimately, we grew from 10 leads/month to 300 leads/month. 

After we sold that company, I wanted to give back to the marketing community. I had developed specialized processes and system for growing companies without a big marketing team or big marketing budget. So, I developed programs to teach other marketers how to do what I did. Training people how to grow their company without a big marketing budget or big marketing teams (and providing supporting services) is what Small Marketing Teams is all about.

Lastly, the bar is really high for me when it comes to marketing advice. It these blogs seems basic or fluffy, I can't use them. I need my audience to know that I understand them better than they understand their marketing strategy. I don't want to talk down to people. I want to be helpful. I need to talk about things that get actual results.  I like three-part story formats for posts (status quo, the problem with the status quo, resolution).

Why do I do this:
I do it for the newly hired marketing director who soon released that the company is relying almost entirely on her magic to grow.
I do this for the law firm that is committed to doing right by their clients and community, but needs more retainers to continue down this path.
I do this for the entrepreneur that  had a good run with word of mouth referrals until something changed in their market and the easy leads dried up.
I do this for the executive that has a new approach that will improve the lives of their prospective customers if they only gave them the chance.
I do this for the business owners that have piece-mealed every shiny marketing object over the past 5 years and are finally frustrated and running out of steam.
I do this for the parters that see companies who were once peers leapfrogging them in their industry.
I do this for the CMO who believes in their company and products, but doesn't have a repeatable process for bring in qualified leads.",1000,Basic - 1000 words,Marketing & Advertising,2,24,1,active,2017-12-09T00:00:00.000-07:00,,209

Court side: Courts can be slow to embrace new technology, so it’s important to highlight the importance of new options/features without saying court clerks need to implement it do their jobs better.

Bone-marrow stem cells - the Holy Grail of Healing - have unique ability to self-replicate throughout the entire life of an organism and to differentiate into cells for organs, tissue, bone...whole body. 

This means your heart, leg muscles, back ligaments and muscle, brain cells, your bone structure, etc. Your body was/is a stem cell producing machine...at least up until age 12 or so, then, like some things, production and proliferation drop, along with one's youth-like ability to heal, mend, and recover almost as quickly as the injury/illness. 

The human body has a mechanism to naturally release stem cells from the bone marrow to send stem cells to various areas of the body for regeneration and repair – we found this can be enhanced nutritionally to phenomenal levels. When there is an injury, tear, collapse, or injured tissue, stem cells are released to support the phenomenon of regeneration and repair in the body. 

(I think there’s a logo here somewhere…very simple – “I’m a bone-marrow stem cell” watch what happens when I repair you…this is what Ponce’ De leon was looking for…).

I want to intersperse (for freshness & longevity of discussions, permutations, etc...) stem cell topics with other health/longevity/rehabilitation/chronic illness related posts/articles to take a position as an expert on stem cell nutrition as the Holy Grail of healing...the touchstone, so to speak.

This blog is for apartments located in Dallas, Texas north of Uptown.

The goal of the blog post is to highlight one or two local events or neighborhood hotspots such as restaurants, shops, etc. in the area as an indirect way of showcasing the apartment community itself. 

Post themes could include best breakfast spots, upcoming festivals within the next month, nearby restaurants etc. 

When choosing an event, pick events that are at least 14 days out from when you submit your post.

If writing about a restaurant - do not just list out menu items and their ingredients. Go into more detail about the atmosphere, fun facts about the restaurant etc.

If writing about a business - do not just list services. Include fun facts, atmosphere, etc.

Link the provided apartment website to a relevant word/phrase. Be sure to include a mention/link to the apartments and end the post with a call-to-action statement (ie: contact us today to learn more!).

If writing about a business - do not just list services. Include fun facts, atmosphere, etc.

We sit above the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) layer and below the Software-as-a-Service layer (SaaS). Public IaaS providers consist of AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform as the main players. There are thousands upon thousands of SaaS providers ranging from Salesforce to Facebook to BlogMutt.

Our software is modeled after one of the original serverless platforms, Google App Engine (GAE). We implement their APIs so that developers can rapidly build applications using the same easy-to-use environment that provides, but with the added benefit that we are open source software and enable customers to deploy their application on any cloud or infrastructure, not just Google. What this allows is multi cloud portability and future-proofing of investments.

Highly technical developers are our primary target audience and our mission is to 1) educate them on the benefits of using GAE's model; and 2) demonstrate why our software is good for their business in terms of application portability. We also serve IT operations and cloud admins, who need to maintain the infrastructure to support running the application.

Recently, the trend has moved away from PaaS, an older market segmentation and one that was not clearly defined, towards Serverless computing. This is how we're positioning ourselves now in order to take advantage of this new trend.

A successful writer will ideally know how to speak to developers and IT operations in a technical language and will really understand the cloud infrastructure industry. Developers and Ops don't have a lot of time, so they want practical how-to information that will help them do their job better and/or faster. If you can speak intelligently about the benefits of containers, know the differences between Kubernetes and Docker, and the pros and cons of PaaS platforms, then you're going to be a great fit for us!

It’s an industry that lags 5-10 years behind most and has only just discovered the benefits of cloud computing, has been driven primarily by tele and field-sales and completely lacks an impartial/consumer resource. 

The industry is changing fast though, payment-first players like Square (US) and iZettle (UK) have gained large customer bases by providing a better way to accept credit/debit cards, but mostly focus on the lower end of the market, “micro-merchants”. Cloud based point of sale systems have done well in the US (Revel Systems, Clover, ShopKeep, Lightspeed, etc.), but the UK is still dominated by PC/Windows based POS systems.

We’re building StoreKit to be the main source for business owners and buyers to find, compare and buy POS and payment products/services. We want to bring transparency and genuinely helpful advice to an industry that lacks it. We also champion new technology that brings the benefits of the cloud, data and analytics.

Target market:
UK-based small to medium sized retail and hospitality (restaurants/cafés) businesses. 

Products:
We currently drive most of our revenue through point of sale hardware (receipt printers, cash drawers, tills, etc.) from direct sales and partnerships with Square, Vend, and a few others. 

We’ve got our ecommerce channel sorted so now our main focus is to generate revenue from lead generation/referrals. Content marketing plays a key role in our ability to drive these visits, leads and referrals. 

We’ve partnered with 30+ POS and payment companies to offer our customers personalised recommendations based on their business. We have a very early, stripped down version here of what will shortly be our main product. 

Content Strategy

We’re primarily targeting small and medium size business owners and IT purchasing managers. This can be anyone from a first-timer starting up their passion project on a budget to a 2-10 store chain IT manager trying to find the best technology products. 

We want to produce helpful, consultative and “actionable” content that solves problems for our readers. See our Trello board for our current content ideas. Data-driven posts are a big plus, and we can produce interactive products/calculators to complement your writing.

Hospitality and retail are two very different sectors and we’ll separate our blog between the two categories.

We favour long form, well-sourced content that covers a topic in-depth over shallow articles, see below for examples. 1000+ words per post in general.

Style & Tone: 

Conversational, authoritative
Detail focused, explaining concepts in-depth and practical advice on how to achieve results
Short paragraphs & easy to skim 
Example Content

Shopify’s blog(https://www.shopify.co.uk/retail) would most closely match our desired style, but FitSmallBusines (e.g. this post on store layouts: http://fitsmallbusiness.com/planning-your-store-layout/), GoCardless (https://gocardless.com/guides/posts/history-of-direct-debit/), Software Advice (http://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/ipad-pos-tips-report-2015/).

We’d also compare ourselves to NerdWallet, Wirecutter and MerchantMaverick in terms of their approach to reviewing products.

Overview - Wine-Oh! is a free mobile app that recommends wine you'll love and provides discounts for you to try them. Our technology uses Artificial Intelligence (specifically machine learning) to predict new wines you'll like based on the aromas and tastes you detect in wines you like. When you rate a wine we'll provide you with the flavors that other members have detected in that wine. Members then choose which flavors they detected to create their own unique tasting profile for a given wine. We use that pattern to connect you to the virtual wine cellars of other users that shared the same tasting profile for the wine. The goal being that you'll probably like other wines from they like because you share the same taste in a wine you both liked. We rank those wines and place the best ones on your Recommendations List.

Business Model - On the back end we've built a system for wine producers and retailers to create discounts in the form of rebates for members to try their wines. Accordingly Wine-Oh! will recommend wines you'll love and the Wine Producer of that wine  and your local retailer might give you a discount to buy it. Members then buy the wine at any retailer and snap a photo of the receipt to prove they bought the wine. The discount amount is transferred to the Members account and they can transfer their balance to their bank account. As such, we only make money when (a) a member receives a rebate discount and (b) when the member purchases the wine. We do not sell or ship wine. 

Rebates vs. Coupons - an important distinction of our service is the difference between rebates and coupons. When you receive a discount at the time of purchase (which lowers how much you pay) that is a coupon. When you receive the discount after you pay, that is a rebate. Rebates one Wine are allowed in every state but one; whereas Coupons on Wine are not allowed in many states.

Value Propositions
Consumer - get wine recommendations and discounts to buy them.
Wine Producer - discover new customers that are predicted to love your wines and increase sales by offering them discounts to buy your wine.
Retailer/Distributor - drive buyers into your store by offering discounts to local members to make your store the best price for wines on their recommendations.

Market Threats - For retailers, online wine sales and Amazon are eating into their wine sales. Although neither is a formidable threat today, as Millennials are becoming the dominant cohort in the wine market these alternative channels will become more prevalent. Amazon is opening distribution centers across the country and their purchase of Whole Foods means that they have many more shelves to deliver from and licenses to sell liquor in many of the hottest wine markets. Wine-Oh! enables retailers to connect with wine buyers and drive them into their stores (where they''ll also put other items into their cart). For Wine Producers, the two tier system of distributors and retailers being between them and the customer means that they don't have any connection to the consumers who purchase and drink their wine. Some consumers will goto their website, join their wine club or sign up for their mailing list. But most of their consumers are unknown to them. Accordingly they can't directly influence sales. However, with Wine-Oh!, they can not only connect with their consumers but also discover new consumers that are likely to enjoy their wines and become loyal customers. 

Intent - We are a pre-launch company desiring to start building up wine related content on our site. 

Customer Acquisition Model - With limited discounts available (e.g. not infinite on every wine), discounts are allocated to Members on a sliding scale with the top members getting discounts first and then down through the ranks to new users. As such we provide members with the ability to improve their status on Wine-Oh!. Some of these include logging usage (e.g. drinking, buying, rating) and inviting others to join Wine-Oh! and follow you (e.g. when you rate a wine it is shared with your following and they might add the wine to their collection to try). Thus we encourage our users to both use Wine-Oh! and invite others to use it too. The payoff being enhancements to one's status and receiving more wine discounts.

Blog Categories - All of our blog posts will go into one of three primary categories in our Community Discussion Section (https://goo.gl/jNkjgU): News, The Lounge or Tips & Tricks. Posts in these sections also show up on the main website (e.g. the News section of the website is a feed of the News Posts from the Community). When submitting an article we would like you to indicate which section you believe it should be placed.

Competition - we don't consider other wine apps competition per se; the closest would be Wine Ring. Others like Vivino, Wine Cellar, Hello Vino and Wine-Searcher have features that overlap with some of ours. We don't mind linking to them but it should be for a very topical reason rather than a casual link (e.g. if it makes the story relevant go ahead and link to them both otherwise avoid wine apps).

In our writing we want to convey that we are experts in our field by offering factual data and well informed opinions wrapped up in fun and easy to read package. We want to speak to friends, not pitch prospects. We want to help the world get a better night's sleep by dismissing the myths, cutting through the misconceptions, and getting down to the core of what you need to achieve great sleep and how it impacts everything you do.

We want to keep our blog light and airy but substantial. Meaning we do not want to engage in heavy topics but we do want our content to be informative and leave the reader with the sense that they learned something or are better off for having read our post.

Overall voice and tone
Playful, but expert
Intelligent
Helpful and informational
Not corporate
Conversational and funny

With this tone it's easy to get (but we DON'T want to be):

Cheesy-funny is one thing, but smart/subtle funny (not lame funny). Examples of cheesy are: Words like Hangry and Yolo, Throwback Thursday, Cat memes, etc...

Average-We are unique people with a unique brand and a unique product. Our words should reflect our uniqueness and we don't do what everyone else does. Examples of average are: (see Cheesy)
 
Unprofessional-We want funny and playful, but with a clear throughline of intelligent expertise and professionalism

Topics to absolutely stay away from: 
Politics and Trump specifically (we take no stance)
Religion (we take no stance)
Heavy news stories (you know...death, destruction, plague-stay away from spreading that vibe)
Our competition (we focus on us, not them)

Epica will inspire and delight its customers with high-quality, elegant, Italian handcrafted products that inspire creativity among its users. Epica will strive to maintain a strong connection to its Italian heritage while also offering a modern/convenient online experience via the world's very highest quality journals and albums. Epica strives to elicit a truly personal experience through its hand-crafted products and personalization for a lasting impression.

Visual Tone and Voice: 
The Epica brand represents quality, Italian craftsmanship, elegance and creative inspiration.  These are the voices that should be conveyed throughout all visual and textual communications.  Whether on our website, social media, specific Ad campaigns or through the presentation of the product itself, the online shopping experience should represent these thematic elements throughout.One of the most unique and important themes to convey through visual and text communications is Epica’s Italian heritage.  Transport our audience to Italy –Florence, which more specifically lies in the heart of Tuscany, is the home of quality bookmaking, hand-cut paper and leather artisans. Florence is known the world over for its quality leather and paper products.  The symbol for the city of Florence is the fleur de lis, which is why Epica uses it as part of its brand image. Florence is also known as the center for the Italian Renaissance, it’s intimately connected with the birth of creative inspiration and expression.Epica products have a visually aesthetic character that is enhanced tactilely- through both touch and smell. Obviously, this is limited by e-commerce, which puts an added burden on marketing to convey the tactile experience visually.  Keep this in mind as you endeavor to express Epica’s unique benefits.

We are looking to create blog posts around the key pain points experienced by law firms & legal departments within Corporate or Government agencies. These are:
•	Managing multiple systems
•	Improving manual processes and reduce double handling
•	The paperless office
•	Outgrowing existing systems
•	Cloud computing
•	Mobility & accessibility
•	Compliance (with trust accounting or process in general)
•	Time recording and billing

In order to be competitive, we believe businesses should employ Strategic Partnerships and have a Regatta BrandAgent on their team to properly represent their brand in the marketplace of potential partners. Rather that always spending money on expensive media and marketing programs, there are almost always opportunities to “look inward” and leverage – even monetize – existing brand marketing and media assets. Doing this properly requires the expertise, perseverance and bandwidth that only a Regatta BrandAgent can offer. Just like having a talent agent is indispensable for athletes, musicians and actors, having a BrandAgent should be seen as a necessary team member for modern consumer brands.

Part of our value proposition is that we can leverage marketing partnerships to produce higher customer engagement and directly lower marketing spend. We do this by offering partners access to the media and marketing that our client has already invested in. You show me yours, I'll show you mine and together we can win.

2) Do not link to any WordPress or Jetpack competitors (Squarespace, Wix, Web.com, Drupal, Joomla, Tumblr, Weebly, Medium, WPBeginner posts, and any other unofficial WordPress websites,  links to or mentions of any direct Jetpack competitors, including but not limited to: Google AdWords, Yoast SEO, WordFence, Clutch, Carbonite, etc.)

3) If you are linking to a report or citing a statistic, please cite the original source of data. For example, do not cite The New York Times if the original data was compiled by an analyst firm. Additionally, links should be no older than 2 years (2016 at the latest).

4) These articles should not focus on explaining how to complete a process with Jetpack. Every article should focus on providing insights into why a user will benefit from the Jetpack features in question. We want readers to learn about new tools and features that can enhance their sites and how they can benefit in ways they were previously unaware of. You may include a few brief sentences about how to activate a tool or feature, but it shouldn't read as a document over a friendly blog post. One way to avoid this is by incorporating as many examples as possible. These can be real ones, or made up ones. Examples help readers visualize how they could potentially use the features being described in the articles to their own advantages. When in doubt - use an example! 

5) Every article should begin with an opener that reveals what will be discussed within. Some great past examples include:

""In this post, we’ll cover why you need to perform regular backups, why they should be made offsite, and offer a solution so that you won’t have to worry about losing your data in the event of a mistake or emergency.""

""Want to learn how to grow your social presence with Jetpack? Keep reading!""

""Read on to learn some tips that will help you build stronger relationships with even stronger contact forms.""

6) Every article should end in a conclusion that includes its own subheading that wraps up the entire piece. There should also be a strong call-to-action at the very end. Some great examples of CTA's include:

""What tips do you have to get more contact forms filled out? Let us know in the comments below, we’d love to hear from you!""

""What tips do you have to keep your site safer? We’d love to hear from you in the comments below""

""Can you think of any other tips or tricks to offer the food blogger community? Share them with us in the comments section below.""

7) Subheadings are strongly encouraged, but they should never be formatted as questions. For example:

""How can Jetpack help you do this?"" 

This is not an appropriate subheading for this program. We want to answer this question in the subhead to explain exactly what the section entails. 

8) Avoid using words like ""simple"" and ""easy"" as we do not want to imply that these processes are simple if some readers are having trouble understanding them. We don't want to make them feel bad. ",800,Basic - 800 words,Software,1,5,6,active,2018-04-06T00:00:00.000-06:00,,91

Philosophy
Chubo was created with the goal of sharing the immense and unparalleled talent of Japanese blacksmiths with chefs and culinary enthusiasts around the world.

Despite the growing awareness and popularity of Japanese kitchen knives around the world, the number of people hand-forging blades, hand finishing edges and crafting handles decreases every year.

We hoped through our business, we could contribute in a small way to preserving an ancient craft and vital source of tools for the culinary world.

Product Lines
When we first started the company, we traveled around Japan meeting blacksmiths and searching out makers who were using traditional forging methods. The Japanese blacksmith world is quite a small and intimate one, so as the company’s grown we’ve also been introduced to other blacksmiths in different regions in Japan. We continue to add to our product lines based on these growing relationships as well as from suggestions we receive from our customers in the culinary industry.

In addition to Japanese kitchen knives we also offer sharpening tools, knife accessories, small kitchenwares, Japanese barware and cocktail supplies and products for Japanese coffee service.

Industry Prices for Everyone, with less overhead than traditional retail we are able to offer high quality products without the margins found in most kitchen stores.

Knife Services
Every Chef knows, your knives are only as good as the blades you are able to maintain. We offer expert sharpening and repair as well as tools and resources to learn to care for your Japanese chef knives. Visit our blog for sharpening techniques and tips and shop our collection of highest quality natural and synthetic sharpening stones.

Customers
It is our honor to supply Japanese chef knives, kitchen tools and tableware for some of the finest chefs and restaurants in the world. You will find our products in use at Daniel, Cosme, Le Coucou, Contra, The Grill, Rose’s Luxury, Pineapple & Pearls, Fork, Spoon & Stable, Rustic Canyon, State Bird Provisions, Quince Restaurant, Senia, Pujol, Dersou, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, Atoboy, Tetsuya’s and Momofuku Seibo to name a few.

Location
Our online store is our primary retail location. We have offices in Tokyo and New York, and our team travels regularly in North America, Oceania, and Europe.

A distributed company with 538 Automatticians in 52 countries speaking 75 different languages, their common goal is to democratize publishing so that anyone with a story can tell it—regardless of income, gender, politics, language, or where they live in the world.

Take a moment to explore the WordPress.com site in order to get a sense of the kinds of users we're speaking to. Visit The Daily Post to get a feel for the Automattic/WordPress.com brand voice, or visit The WordPress.com Blog for additional WordPress.com-related information.

WordPress.com vs. WordPress.org
While they share many things in common, .org and .com are two different entities. This content program is for WordPress.com, so content should be focused around that ecosystem. See here for more information on what makes them different.

Program Objectives
The Automattic content marketing site is a place where business-minded creators and do-ers can find the information they need to kick-start their businesses online. It's a place where they can find the key advice they need to achieve their online goals—today and tomorrow.

We offer a new, pragmatic perspective on launching a website. Doing so doesn't have to be daunting—not in today's business world. We empower independent makers and do-ers to achieve their goals for standing up and evolving their web presence.

Mission Statement
If you're a business owner or creator striving to better communicate with and serve your audience, you've probably already asked yourself: ""Do I need a website?"" For those that aren't already online, that's a tough question to tackle. After all, many independent business owners and creators don't really know what goes into standing up a website, or how they can benefit from one.

With our content, we will provide the knowledge, insights, and information today's business owners and creators need to bring their passion online—one (small) step at a time.",450,Basic - 450 words,,0,3,6,active,2018-05-21T00:00:00.000-06:00,,46

We want to improve those communications and offer a more personalized, interactive experience to empower every student affected.

Our blog posts typically discuss:

The answers to questions that readers may have
Subjects related to the practice areas, not necessarily the practice areas themselves (e.g., if a family law attorney, write about children or marriage)
Guides to approaching different legal issues or situations (e.g., what to do after a car accident, how to find a good personal injury attorney, how to collect and preserve evidence after a truck accident)
Current news that is relevant to the firm's practice areas (e.g., the #metoo movement for a student issues attorney, Stand Your Ground cases for a civil rights or criminal defense attorney)
Important case decisions that touch on the firm’s practice areas (but be careful with/limit these—may be difficult for writers to properly convey the standing of the case and interpret how it will affect future cases). 
Explanation of legal policies relevant to the firm's practice areas

Blogs are targeted toward a general audience. While they may contain some marketing, their primary purpose is to showcase expertise, provide interesting information, educate visitors, build trust in the firm, and answer questions.

- Use Work placement or Workplace practical training rather than work experience when referring to students who are studying with us and are undertaking the practical component of the course. We use the term work experience for students who  might want to improve their eligibility for our course. e.g. We recommend applicants gain work experience in the animal care industry prior to submitting an application.  
- On-campus rather than on campus
- Full-time rather than fulltime
- We don't tend to use the 'z' in Australia as much as the 's' - hard to get used to but it is empathise rather than empathize, specialise rather than specialize.

There are a few common veterinary words which are spelled slightly differently in Australia. The spelling we use:-
- Anaesthetic  
- Behaviour

After 15 years experience as a Top 10 SEO Company globally, you can now tap into our insider know-how to help you choose the best SEO company for your business. Now seoWorks creates genuinely independent lists of the Best SEO Companies worldwide.

So, why did we change? Simple really. SEO has become a huge business and there are many, many SEO companies (some say too many) and we could have continued as a successful boutique SEO firm. But, in reality, we simply heard one too many tales of woe from unhappy prospective clients.

And we decided to do something about it.
